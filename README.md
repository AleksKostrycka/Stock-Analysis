# Stock-Analysis
## **Overview of Project**
In this Challange we performed a refactoring of a code already written during the course of Module 2. Steve was thirlled with the product that we delivered during the Module and would like to continue to use it, but expand his dataset. While the code we wrote during the module works for a few stocks over 2 years, it would take a long time to run if we expanded to more stocks, and several more years. Steve would like to be able to use it to run data from the entire stock market. Our challange is to refactor the code that we already wrote so it can run more efficiently, by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 
## **Results** 
After completing the excercise to refract the code we found that it runs much faster than the original code, while producting the same resutls.Below are the result screenshots displaying the time it took for the orginial code to run, and the time it took the refactored code to complete the same excercise was significantly shorter than the orginial. Below are results:
#### 1. Original Code: 2017 Stock Analysis Run Time Resutls:

#### 2. Original Code: 2018 Stock Analysis Run Time Resutls:

#### 3. Refactored Code: 2017 Stock Analysis Run Time Resutls:

#### 4. Refactored Code: 2018 Stock Analysis Run Time Resutls:

Comparing the screenshots above it is clear that the refactoring of the code significantly improved the run time. For 2017 the run time was reduced from .6 seconds to .1 second, showing significant improvement. For 2018 the run time was reduced from .6 seconds to .13 seconds. For both years we can see the same type of improvement. 

The actual results of the analysis are the same regardless of the code used. Below are the screenshots of the results found by analyzing stocks in year 2017 and 2018.

Form the above resutls we can see that majority of the stocks that we were looking at were performing very well in 2017, and performed rather poorly in 2018. As this is a pattern in all the stocks that we were looking at, the person using the analysis, Steve can look at the macro economical conditions and changes year over year to identify the differences in the economy between the two years that might have caused all of these particular stocks to do worse, maybe the entire stock market was trading lower in 2017 than 2018. Another step that can be taken from this analysis is to look at the growth period of each of these stocks. 2017 seemed like a growth year, then the prices of these stocks were very high in the begining of 2018, through out the year the growth could have slowed and caused the prices to drop uby the end of 2018. Two stocks that are hilighted in 2018 are ENPH and RUN which have positive growth in both years, this could indicate that these stocks are contiously growing and with a little more research could be potentially good stocks to invest in.

## **Summary**
### **Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code**
The overall advantages of refactoring code are the follwing; first it can make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, second, it uses less memory from your device, and lastly it improves the logic of the code to make it easier and cleaner for future users to read. All three were seen while completing the refactoring of the original Stock Analysis code. 
The overall disadvantages of refactoring the code are the follwing: If the code is very long and complicated it can be difficult to refactor. The coding team might not have the resources or time available to be able to refactor the code. If the code if very complex, refactoring of it can introduce unwanted bugs.
