# Stock-Analysis
## **Overview of Project**
In this Challange we performed a refactoring of a code already written during the course of Module 2. Steve was thirlled with the product that we delivered during the Module and would like to continue to use it, but expand his dataset. While the code we wrote during the module works for a few stocks over 2 years, it would take a long time to run if we expanded to more stocks, and several more years. Steve would like to be able to use it to run data from the entire stock market. Our challange is to refactor the code that we already wrote so it can run more efficiently, by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 
## **Results** 
After completing the excercise to refract the code we found that it runs much faster than the original code, while producting the same resutls.Below are the result screenshots displaying the time it took for the orginial code to run, and the time it took the refactored code to complete the same excercise was significantly shorter than the orginial. Below are results:
